This contains the scripts for running my camera application on MCLinux. Running OpenCV-Python only requires a pip install.
MCLinux does not have pip, so pip has to be sideloaded. I have included the pip files.
The video_gui.py file requires TKInter. TKInter is not install on MCLinux, so those dependencies have to be sideloaded. Those files are too big to fit as a single zipped file, so I might email them.
RTSP publishing I have done little with since I still have not had a chance to test it on MFoCS hardware.

***This code is very immature since I still have changing requirements.***
